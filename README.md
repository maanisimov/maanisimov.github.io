## Thinking Out Loud

Hi, my name is Max, I am a data scientist / quant currently working at causaLens in London. I am using this website to reflect on, dig deep into and share things I have learned. I hope this website will help you understand world better and raise interest in fields I am passionate about.

[Machine Learning](ML.md). 
[Financial Mathematics](FM.md). 
[Biohacking](BIOHACKING.md): mostly on how to prepare yourself for marathons. Probably will cover tennis as well, but then the page will need renaming.
